        <h3>Abu Dhabi's Rich History*</h3>
        <p>
          Ancient settlements of the region can be traced back as far as over 5000 years ago, and have
          been found around parts of Abu Dhabi, such as Jebel Hafeet near Al Ain
          and on the island of Umm al Nar. Abu Dhabi’s most significant
          settlement was those of the Bani Yas Bedouin tribe which were located
          by the coast around the 16th Century. The discovery of
          fresh water led the tribe to relocate to the island, which was more
          fertile with large quantities of wildlife. Soon, the ruling Al
          Nahyan family decided to flee to the island as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the rule of Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa, Abu Dhabi
          developed through the trading of pearls, and in 1892 the very
          first exclusive treaty, linking Abu Dhabi with Great Britain, was signed. The
          emirates location was seen as a tremendous strategic convenience
          connecting it with India and the east, and it was established as the
          Trucial Coast.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abu Dhabi’s wealth was looking on the upside until it was severely
          hit by the intervention of Japan’s pearl industry and also by the
          1930’s global recession. Furthermore, Sheik Zayed bin Khalifa passed
          away, which added more uncertainty to Abu Dhabi’s prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this was not the end of Abu Dhabi’s fortunes. In 1939 Sheikh
          Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan granted petroleum concession to the
          Trucial Coast Development Oil Company, (renamed the Abu Dhabi
          Petroleum Company, ADPC, in 1962) in a bid to search for vast oil
          reserves. In 1958, huge offshore oil reserves were discovered, and a
          year later onshore reserves were also found. It was not until 1962
          that the oil exports began, leading Abu Dhabi on to the road of
          unbelievable wealth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1966 Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan became the new ruler of Abu
          Dhabi, and two years later he formed the federation of the United Arab
          Emirates, which was in response to the British threatening to withdraw
          from the region by the end of 1971. The ruler of Abu Dhabi realised
          that his connection with Britain was vital to maintain a strong
          position in the oil industry. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahayan was
          elected as the first president and with the assistance of the British,
          started to carry out his vision of developing the country with the
          advantage of increased oil revenues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sheikh Zayed is known as the ‘Father of the Nation’ due to his
          significant developments of the city of Abu Dhabi. Unfortunately, he
          passed away in 2004. His son Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan was
          elected as president and has made sure he continued his father’s
          legacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sheik Khalifa has invested oil reserves sensibly to boost tourism
          figures. With the outstanding determination of the Al Nahyan family
          reign, anything is possible. Key fascinating and impressive
          developments have been implemented, such as Saadiyat Island and Al
          Grum Resort to attract visitors from all over the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, has come a long way; rapidly
          re-constructing itself into a beautiful city, with extraordinary
          skyscrapers, shopping malls, top quality hotels and picturesque
          gardens. It is undoubtedly very different from what it was 50 years
          ago, but its history still remains a prominent factor in its path to
          success. (*See Attributions Page)
