          <p>
            The Black Tap website uses beautiful photos with a simple black and
            white color scheme to emphasize their products. There is plenty of
            white space around the text to help the words and pictures stand out
            on the page. There isn't too much information and the designers let
            the pictures do the talking. The website looks good on both large
            and small viewports.

          <h3>PARC-Alignment</h3>

          <p>
            This page has its text aligned to the left. This helps keep the page
            clean and easy to read as well as directing your eye to the arrows
            on the left of each image. The images are also aligned to each other
            in groups of 3 on a big viewport and individually on a small
            viewport. There is one exception to this about halfway down the page
            where 2 pictures overlap. This change in alignment creates contrast
            and makes the overall page even more appealing.

            This Canadian-based architecture firm's website is a great example
            of using contrast in design. The white background helps the orange
            titles stand out as well as the dark gray body text. The photos on
            the page are beautiful and also demonstrate good contrast. The page
            isn't overcrowded and overall, is pleasing to look at.
